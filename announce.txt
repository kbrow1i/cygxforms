Subject: XForms 1.2.4-2

Cygwin's XForms library has been updated to version 1.2.4-2.  This
consists of the following packages:

* libforms2-1.2.4-2
* libforms-devel-1.2.4-2
* libforms-doc-1.2.4-2

XForms is a GUI toolkit based on the X library for X Window Systems.
It features a rich set of objects, such as buttons, sliders, and menus
etc., integrated into an easy and efficient object/event callback
execution model that allows fast and easy construction of
X-applications.  In addition, the library is extensible and new
objects can easily be created and added to the library.
