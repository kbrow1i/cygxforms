XForms is a GUI toolkit based on the X library for X Window Systems.
It features a rich set of objects, such as buttons, sliders, and menus
etc., integrated into an easy and efficient object/event callback
execution model that allows fast and easy construction of
X-applications.  In addition, the library is extensible and new
objects can easily be created and added to the library.
